      "description": "Colossus of Destiny was born in the Paris region in 2010. After two EPs and their debut album \"In Lesser Brightness\" (2013), inspired by Mastodon, Gojira, and Baroness, the band toured Cuba in 2017. Their LP \"Last Call\" (2020) introduced progressive and post-rock elements with influences from Underoath and Devil Sold His Soul. With \"Peter Palmer\" (2022), the band shifted to a more modern, hardcore-driven sound. In 2024, \"Beyond the Shallow Mind\" continued this direction. In 2025, \"Jerry June\" deepens their post-metal identity with a raw, intense track accompanied by a bold cinematic music video."
